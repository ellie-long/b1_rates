./new_proj_b1.sh plots the projected b1 based on the output of ../ptrates
	Right now it's plotting the following:
		A bunch of theory curves
		HERMES b1 data points
		Projected HMS b1 points
		Projected SHMS points


./cov.sh plots the projected kinematics coverage based on ../output/xs.out
	It plots Q^2 vs. x_Bjorken for iSpec = 1 or 2 (HMS or SHMS) and x is in the first x bin

./kin_cov.sh plots the projected kinematics coverage based on ../output/xs.out
	It differs from cov.sh in that it includes a W>2 cut-off
